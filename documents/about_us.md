# About OrganicDough Donuts

## Our Story

OrganicDough Donuts began in 2015 in a small kitchen in Portland, Oregon, when founder Maya Chen, a former environmental scientist, decided to combine her passion for sustainable food systems with her love of artisanal baking.

After witnessing the environmental impact of conventional agriculture firsthand, Maya became determined to create a food business that prioritized both taste and planetary health. Her vision: reimagine the humble donut as a vehicle for sustainable ingredients and culinary creativity.

Starting with a single stand at the Portland Farmers Market, Maya's organic creations quickly developed a loyal following. The combination of unique flavors, local ingredients, and environmental commitment struck a chord with the community. 

Within two years, we opened our first brick-and-mortar location in downtown Portland, followed by our Eastside shop in 2019 and Westside location in 2022.

Today, OrganicDough Donuts remains independently owned, employs over 45 people, and serves as a model for how food businesses can thrive while upholding rigorous environmental and social standards.

## Our Philosophy

### Food as a Force for Good

We believe that food businesses have tremendous power to shape agricultural systems, communities, and environmental outcomes. Every ingredient choice, every partner, and every process at OrganicDough reflects our commitment to being a positive force in the food system.

### Transparency & Trust

We invite our customers to know exactly what they're eating and how it was produced. This commitment to transparency extends from our open-kitchen design to our detailed ingredient lists and producer profiles.

### Taste & Joy

While we take our environmental commitments seriously, we never compromise on taste. We believe sustainable food should be a joy to eat, not a sacrifice. Our team of bakers continually experiments with new techniques and flavor combinations to ensure that every donut delivers both pleasure and peace of mind.
