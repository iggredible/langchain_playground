# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What makes your donuts different from conventional donuts?
Our donuts are made with 100% certified organic ingredients, including locally milled flour, organic cane sugar, and eggs from free-range hens. We never use artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, or hydrogenated oils. Our commitment to quality ingredients and small-batch production results in a more flavorful, fresher donut that's better for both people and the planet.

### Are your donuts baked or fried?
Most of our donuts are traditionally fried in organic, non-GMO sunflower oil. However, we do offer a selection of baked cake donuts for those who prefer them. Both options are clearly marked on our menu.

### How long do your donuts stay fresh?
Since we don't use preservatives, our donuts are best enjoyed the same day they're made. If you need to keep them for the next day, store in an airtight container at room temperature. We don't recommend refrigerating donuts as it can affect their texture.

### Do you deliver?
Yes! We offer several delivery options:
- Direct delivery from our stores within a 5-mile radius (minimum order of 1 dozen)
- Third-party delivery through GrubHub, UberEats, and DoorDash
- Special event catering delivery throughout the Portland metro area

## Ingredients & Dietary Questions

### Are any of your donuts vegan?
Yes, we offer a dedicated vegan donut line made without any animal products. Our vegan options are made with organic plant milks and plant-based egg replacers. They're just as delicious as our traditional donuts!

### Are your donuts gluten-free?
We currently offer gluten-free donuts on Wednesdays and Saturdays only. Our kitchen does process wheat flour, so while our gluten-free donuts are made with certified gluten-free ingredients, they may not be suitable for those with severe celiac disease due to potential cross-contamination.

### What kind of oil do you use for frying?
We use organic, non-GMO, expeller-pressed sunflower oil for all our fried donuts. We change our oil frequently and recycle used oil into biodiesel.

### Do your donuts contain nuts?
Some of our flavors contain nuts, which are clearly marked on our menu. All donuts are made in a facility that processes various tree nuts, so we cannot guarantee that any product is completely nut-free.

### Where do you source your ingredients?
We source 85% of our ingredients from within 100 miles of Portland. Our website features a map of all our supplier farms and producers, along with stories about the people who grow our food. For tropical ingredients like vanilla and chocolate, we work with fair trade certified suppliers.
